# Clothes_Classification
After created a Slipper Classifier using Logistic Regression, I wanted to use a more advanced Machine Learning method to train a more complex model. 
Expending from slippers, I planed to train a model to recognize different clothes. 

The database includes 6 categories: hat, pants, shoes, skirt, Tshirt and others. 
With a total number of 3293 Training images and 366 Validation images. 

The performance of this model is: Training Accuracy is 96.88%; Validation Accuracy is 88.36%.
